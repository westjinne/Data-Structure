1.1 Data structure and Algorithm
================================

1.1.1 Concept of Data Structure
--------------------------------
(1) Abstract data type : datas and models (of data's operation) ex) Integer, Phonebook, Stack, Queue
(2) Data type : dta object provided by programming language and valid operations. 
(3) Data structure : data organization, management and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. 
                     ex) Stack, Queue, Binary tree, Graph

1.1.2 Relationship between Data structure and Algorithm
--------------------------------
(1) Program = Data Structure + Algorithm
(2) If the program is a sentence, the data structure must be nouns and algorithm be verbs. 

1.4 Algorithm Analysis
--------------------------------
* Algorithm  = 
(1) input 
(2) output 
(3) definiteness 
(4) finiteness (it must be end after finite steps)
(5) effectiveness 

1.4.5 Effectiveness of Algorithm and complexity function
